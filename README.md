# Module 9 Challenge:  README Generator

This application uses JavaScript and Node.JS to obtain user input to create a README Markdown file.  The README that is created is stored in a separate directory titled "createdREADMEs" so as not be confused with the README you are currently reading, and to prevent overwriting.

A walkthrough video of this code functioning can be seen using the following link:

A README file created using this code is included in the createdREADMEs directory for you to view.  A screenshot of the created README is seen below.
